FormInput is my main form, containing the logic for selecting valid days based on what month and year is selected, including leap years, adding and removing the elements 29-31 based on what the user has selected. This form passes a lucky number to FormOutput using the getLucky method, which is used by FormOutput to modify a label to output the user's lucky number.
