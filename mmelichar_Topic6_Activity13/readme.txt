I attempted to make an AI to play the first two turns of tic-tac-toe with 100% accuracy. Given that I couldn't get it functioning past the first turn and was chewing up too much time, I switched it to randomly selecting a space to go in. Given more time I would have liked to have gotten my functions working, though I feel that I was too scatter-brained in my approach, as a lot of my variables were there for ideas I was having and then forgot about as I swapped to another idea. It's pretty disorganized, but diagnosing issues with the CPU functions to play were exceedingly difficult because each change required a change in 18 locations given that there are 9 buttons and 2 options for a player playing as either X or O.
